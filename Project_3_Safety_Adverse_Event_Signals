#Safety / Adverse Event Signal Explorer

##Pharmacovigilance Analytics Dashboard (FAERS Q4-2024)

##Overview

This project presents an interactive pharmacovigilance dashboard built using FDA FAERS adverse event data to support drug safety signal detection, prioritization, and surveillance.

The dashboard integrates disproportionality metrics (PRR and ROR) with reporting volume to identify potential drug–event safety signals while maintaining analytical transparency and regulatory-grade interpretability.

##Objectives

Detect potential adverse event safety signals using PRR and ROR

Prioritize high-risk drug–event combinations

Visualize signal clustering and reporting patterns

Monitor quarterly reporting trends for surveillance context

##Key Features

-Top Adverse Events by Reports

-Top Drugs by Reports

-PRR vs ROR Signal Detection Scatter Plot

-High-Risk Safety Signal Review Table

-Signal Strength Heatmap (PRR intensity)

-Quarterly Reporting Trend (Q3–Q4 2024)

-Signal metrics are available for Q4-2024 only. Reporting trends include Q3–Q4 to provide surveillance context.

Dashboard Design Principles

Separation of exposure frequency and disproportionality signal strength

Transparent handling of temporal data availability

Interactive filtering by drug and adverse event

Interpretive annotations to prevent analytical misinterpretation
