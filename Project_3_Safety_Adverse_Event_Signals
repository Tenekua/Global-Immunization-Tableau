# Safety / Adverse Event Signal Explorer

## Pharmacovigilance Analytics Dashboard (FAERS Q4-2024)

## Overview
This project presents an interactive pharmacovigilance dashboard built using FDA FAERS adverse event data to support drug safety signal detection, prioritization, and surveillance.

The dashboard integrates disproportionality metrics (PRR and ROR) with reporting volume to identify potential high-risk drug–event safety signals.

## Objectives
- Detect potential adverse event safety signals using PRR and ROR
- Prioritize high-risk drug–event combinations
- Visualize signal clustering and reporting patterns
- Monitor quarterly reporting trends for surveillance context

## Key Features
- PRR vs ROR signal detection scatterplot
- High-risk safety signal review table
- Signal strength heatmap across drug–event pairs
- Quarterly adverse event reporting trend

## Data Sources
- FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
- Q4 2024 publicly available signal and report count datasets

## Tools Used
- Tableau Public
- Excel (data preparation)
